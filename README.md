For this assignment, you will need to write code that reads a string of DNA letters and counts the numbers of As, Cs, Gs, and Ts found in the string.  Your code must read a file named "input" and create a file named "output" that contains exactly 4 integers separated by spaces that represent the numbers of each letter in the order specified above.  For example, for input:

ACGTCGTGTT

the output should be:

1 2 3 4

Note that the input string may comprise more than one line - you will have to be able to handle end of line characters.
